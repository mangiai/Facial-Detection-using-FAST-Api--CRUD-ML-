# FastAPI with Machine Learning

## Author
Muhammad Ahsan

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with FastAPI, enabling robust API management along with advanced image processing capabilities. The application allows users to upload images, which are then processed to detect and crop faces using machine learning techniques.

## Enhanced Features

- **Image Upload**: Provides a secure and efficient way for users to upload images to the server for processing.

- **Face Detection**: Leverages cutting-edge machine learning models to accurately identify and locate faces within images.

- **Image Cropping**: Once a face is detected, the application can automatically crop the face from the image, facilitating further analysis or storage.

- **Facial Recognition**: Not only does the application detect faces, but it can also recognize individual features, offering the potential for various biometric and demographic analyses.

- **User Management**: Complete user management capabilities allow for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of user information in a secure manner, supporting robust user authentication and data integrity.

- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with SQL databases using SQLAlchemy, providing a solid backend foundation for data persistence and manipulation.

- **API Management**: Utilizes FastAPI's state-of-the-art design to handle HTTP requests and responses, providing clear and efficient API management and version control.

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporates machine learning operations directly into the API, allowing for sophisticated image and data processing tasks to be performed as part of the request handling workflow.

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Capable of handling asynchronous requests, enhancing performance and scalability by allowing for non-blocking database operations and external API calls.

- **Caching**: Implements caching mechanisms to improve performance and response times, reducing the load on the server for frequently requested data.

- **Security Features**: Includes robust security measures like JWT-based authentication and HTTPS support, ensuring that user data and communications are secure.

- **Swagger Documentation**: Automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI, making it easy to test and understand the API's capabilities.

- **Dockerization**: Containerized using Docker to ensure a consistent and isolated environment, simplifying deployment and scaling across different platforms and infrastructures.

- **Unit Testing**: Comes with a suite of unit tests, ensuring that all components of the application work as expected and facilitating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines.

- **Customizable**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily add new features or modify existing ones to suit different requirements.

- **Contribution Friendly**: Open for contributions, the project encourages developers to suggest improvements, report issues, and submit pull requests, fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment.


## Technologies Used
- **FastAPI**: As the core framework to create RESTful APIs.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **MediaPipe**: Used for accurate face detection in images.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistency across different deployment environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for deployment)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-machine-learning.git
   cd fastapi-machine-learning
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Locally
To run the application locally, execute:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Endpoints
- `POST /token`: Login endpoint, returning an access token.
- `POST /users/`: Create a new user.
- `GET /users/{user_id}`: Retrieve a user by their ID.
- `DELETE /users/{user_id}`: Delete a user by their ID.
- `POST /upload-image/`: Process image uploads for face detection and other operations.
- `POST /upload-and-return-image/`: Upload an image and return it.
- `POST /upload-and-crop-face/`: Upload an image and crop the detected face.
- `GET /docs`: Access the automatically generated Swagger UI to interact with the API.


## Docker Deployment
To build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t fastapi-ml .
docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-ml
```
